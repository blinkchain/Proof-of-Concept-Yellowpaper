# Time Architecture
*[@jobyreuben](https://www.github.com/jobyreuben) Author Comment*
- Whitepaper Section [2.1], Level : Node
- The Time Architecture in Blinkchain is segregated into Epoch = 10,000 blocks; Slot = 400 blocks ; Packet = 1 block.
- These time frames are not correlated to the ledger, as it only knows block heights. It is only taken in the following area
- Election conducted every epoch (10,000 blocks)
- Announcing Leaders for every Epochs, Slots and Packets
- Taking Variable Data to form constraints in the consensus e.g., Total Volume in an Epoch, Each individual block time in an epoch/slot, etc
- Cardano, a UTXO based blockchain uses these timeframes, thus it is implemented and running https://developers.cardano.org/docs/stake-pool-course/introduction-to-cardano/#slots-and-epochs
- Its feasibility is proved with previous implementations and it does not affects or changes consensus protocols. As block heights are only taken for constraints, these time frames - Epoch, Slots and Packets are quasi and can be much more human readable. The alternatives would be reciting all constraints in block heights which cannot be developer friendly. The outcome can be achieved seamlessly.

# Epoch Election

Epoch Election conducted every 10,000 blocks (1 Epoch) to announce packet leaders who are eligible to produce their blocks. Block producers are announced before the epoch starts. The following steps starts from attesting proofs to participate in the election to getting selected to mint a block to commencing the epoch.


> **Quick Info** üí°
> 
> **Producer Arrival** represents new nodes arrival to contest in the Epoch election to produce new blocks. For Arrival a specific slot is allocated range of x to y block heights in every epoch for the next epoch production. Existing and new producers carry out same process, but new nodes tend to have a criteria to be fulfilled, whereas the existing nodes does infact proved passing the criteria for the previous epoch.

## Vote of Confidence Result


## Selection of Bandwidth Proof

> **Quick Info** üí°
> 
> **Bandwidth Proofs** - to be proposed in a new paper "Blink Proofs" will provide a zero knowledge proof to the verfiers (nodes) to calculate its authenticity and ability to contest in the new election to directly influencing to change the block size of the epoch.

*[@jobyreuben](https://www.github.com/jobyreuben) Author Comment*

- Whitepaper Section - Nil, Passive Program, Level : Node
- Bandwidth Proofs in the ledger in a range of block height X to Y (Denoting Slot opening and ending for Arrival of New nodes) are selected and validated to carry on further steps. Since proofs are available directly in the ledger, it is easier to select the proofs. Only recent proofs are taken and the requirement should be fulfilled.
- The requirement will be published on after every epoch's Vote of Confidence motion.
- The implementation can be done effectively with optimized language suitable.

Generate a Json file with  PublicKey with verified bandwidth proofs

1. *Input_Json is the json file with all the blocks*
2. *Output_json is the json file with only the info of the verified bandwidth proofs*
3. *Validate_proof is a function that validated the proof returns true or false*


```

Function Bandwidth_proof_selection (range_begin,range_end,Input_Json) 
{
  In_Data<----Input_Json // only data within the given range
  Out_Data<---- Output_Json 
  For i = range_end, i>=range_begin , i --
  {
  If In_Data[i] position has bandwidth proof 
      If Out_Data not have PublicKey && Validate_proof(PublicKey)
        Write Out_Data with [UTXO index,Transaction ID,Block height,wallet ID]<----In_Data[i]
      End if
  End if
  }
Return Output_Json
}
```

## Node Weight & Total Packets Calculation

- Whitepaper Section 3.2 - 3.2.1, Active, Level: Node
- Node Weights represent, each node's current honesty weight. For every epoch along with the Bandwidth Proof, nodes are required to attach their updated weight which can be validated if true.
- $NodeWeight(N_w)=\sum N(W_n) + Bandwidth (Bits/sec)$
- All of selected bandwith proof's node's weights are summed up to find total packets each node can produce
- $Total Packets (P) = \frac{10,000 \times N_w}{\sum_{1}^{n} (N_w)_n}$

- If Total packets allocated < 10000, then the remaining packets are allocated to nodes with highest positive weight excluding the bandwidth proof.
- Challenges will be script development for Node weight snapshot and validation of it, which also can be effectively achieved.

## Allocation of Leaders

- Whitepaper Section 3.2.2 - 3.2.3, Passive, Level: Node
- Since each node's total packets production rate is achieve for the next epoch, each packet's height has to be determined for which node to produce in a determinable randomized structure. Thus, packet leaders are announced, or determined by each node on the network from only the randomized parameters
- First Packet shall be produced by the highest number of packet allocated node i.e., the strongest & most honest node
- Likewise, for every 400 blocks, the strongest of it shall be announced as slot leader, who does not have first packet slot privilleges, but assigned to propagate transactions properly.
- Allocation works like Bitcoin's Difficulty rate and nonce. For each packet a $K$ Output is given in MD160 (Same as PKH address) produced from an assigned n Block's Merkle Root $(H)$ of all transactions which will be random.
- $K=MD160(SHA256((SHA256(H))+Packet_n+Slot_n+Epoch_n))$
- Any node's PublicKeyHash $(N_x)$ lesser than $K$, shall be selected as the Packet's Producer. $Leader = K_p > N_x$
- $K$ is rehashed during same leader continuous producer assignment or if no lesser $N_x$ value than $K$ is found.
- After the packets are allocated and confirmed, the delegators can verify and collateralize for their tokens for the specific packets
- Challenges will be node's having a different $H$ value due to forks, but can be achieved if a confirmed block's merkle root is taken. If any one node fails to achive common consensus on packet leaders, its propagation/minting will not be accepted and it will get dishonesty weightage.

## Block Size \& Time Fixing

- Whitepaper Section (2.3.1, 2.3.4, 2.3.5) , Passive, Level: Node
- Bandwidth Proofs taken for next epoch shall provide the network's handling throughput bits per second. From these proofs, the block time and size is calculated and posted for the next epoch block production.
- According to Whitepaper we have to take median bandwidth, but since Vote of confidence kicks un-fit nodes, it can improve requirements for new node arrival which will have increased bandwidth. Hence the median bandwidth is not taken.
- Instead, taking the lowest bandwith shall provide the minimum propagation possibility per second. This process can be done right after the [Selection of Bandwidth Proof](#-selection-of-bandwidth-proof)
- $Epoch_n(BlockMaxSize_{bits}/sec)=Min(B_1,B_2,....B_n)$
- Per Block time is calculated from Median Time from previous epoch i.e., n-2 epoch for the newly produced epoch
- $Epoch_n BlockTime (\tau) = Epoch_{n-2} Median BlockTime (\tau)$
- From the per block time, we can calculate per block size as the Block size per second (1) is calculated previously.
- $Epoch_n(BlockSize)=BlockMaxSize_{bits}/sec \times BlinkTime$ 
-  Note : Per second in Blinkchain is 1 Legate = Legacy Hardware Single Thread H/s. Hence, Block Time in seconds denotes legates i.e., 1 sec = 1 legate.

## Vote of Confidence (Requirement)

> **Quick Info** üí°
> 
> **Vote of Confidence** - To scale the blink-network and avoid latencies due to incompetance to propagate transactions faster, the network decides on a vote to kick un-fit nodes as per its requirement. Vote of Confidence involves selection, voting, and elimination by increasing requirements for kicked nodes to participate in the election as a contestant.

- Whitepaper Section 3.1.2, Active, Level: Node
- Vote of confidence can improve requirement therby increasing the difficulty rate to join the producer cluster. Thus way better and bandwidth stronger nodes capable for faster propagation can join.
- To eliminate nodes, the mean value of all selected bandwidth of nodes shall be taken as a threshold to vote on elimination
- Each node shall have a rate of elimination percentage for which it can vote. This is to offload decentralization ethics towards node-operators. Minimum the rate of elimination, maximum the decentralization of the network.
- Each node can vote on un-fit nodes below its rate of elimination of the mean value, till the next selection of bandwidth-proofs. The VoC result will be published before the Selection of Bandwidth Proofs.

## Escrow Rate (Requirement)

> **Quick Info** üí°
> 
> **Escrow Rate** - To restrict spending of blinkcoins, blinkchain's native coin during recessions, bear markets similar to a central bank that icreases borrowing rates to reduce spending. Escrow rates are levied to delegators on their blinkcoins to retrict certain supply for a fixed amount of period i.e., 500 epochs (5,000,000 blocks) or approx 21 days. This rate is known as SERC (Staking Escrow Rates for Collateral) which will be hiked, lowered according to market conditions determined by the network per epoch.

*[@jobyreuben](https://www.github.com/jobyreuben) Author Comment*
- Whitepaper Section - Nil, Passive Program, Level : Script
- After creation of bandwidth proof, it should be attested as a transaction in the ledger, where validators can verify and take it for epoch election
- Similar to wallet clients constructing a transaction, the node itself constrcuts the proof, attest it to a transaction and propagates it
- Since it is a common process found in various applications, it can be developed efficiently. The bandwidth proof creation shall be instructed in the new papers.
